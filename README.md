## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### The Prompt-Driven Workflow

The system operates through a series of interconnected prompt files that guide AI agents through the content creation process:

    B --> C[Release Notes Downloaded]
    C --> D[extract-feature-from-RN.prompt.md]
    D --> E[features_X.X.md Generated]
    E --> F[generate-training.prompt.md]
    F --> G[Training Files Created]
    E --> H[generate-resource-kit.prompt.md]

## 🔄 Workflow Deep Dive

### Phase 1: Data Acquisition

#### `retrieve-RN-VSCode.prompt.md`

**Purpose**: Fetches the latest VS Code release notes from the official repository.

**Key Features**:

- Uses Perplexity API to find latest VS Code version
- Queries microsoft/vscode-docs repository via GitHub API
- Downloads release notes in original markdown format
- Creates version-specific files (`vscode_X.X.md`)

**AI Tools Used**: `perplexity-ask`, `github`

#### `extract-feature-from-RN.prompt.md`

**Purpose**: Parses release notes to extract a structured list of features.

**Process**:

1. Reads the downloaded release notes
2. Identifies and catalogs new features
3. Creates structured feature lists with descriptions
4. Generates `features_X.X.md` files for downstream processing

**Output Format**:

```markdown
# VS Code 1.102 Features

## Chat Enhancements
- **Custom Chat Modes**: Create specialized chat experiences...
- **MCP Protocol Support**: Connect to external data sources...

## Editor Experience
- **Auto-approval for Terminal Commands**: Streamline command execution...
```

### Phase 2: Content Generation

#### `generate-training.prompt.md`

**Purpose**: Creates comprehensive training documentation for each feature.

**Workflow**:

1. Reads feature catalog (`features_X.X.md`)
2. For each feature:
   - Uses Perplexity to research additional context
   - Applies the `feature-training.md` template
   - Generates structured training content
3. Saves files as `feature_[name].md` in version directory

**Template Structure**:

- **YAML Front Matter**: Metadata (feature, release, prerequisites, audience)
- **Overview Section**: Feature summary and primary benefits
- **Why It Matters**: Problem solved, target users, context
- **Feature Details**: Prerequisites, access methods, step-by-step usage
- **Practical Examples**: Code snippets, configuration samples
- **Common Use Cases**: Real-world scenarios
- **Integration**: How it works with other features
- **Troubleshooting**: Common issues and solutions

#### `generate-resource-kit.prompt.md`

**Purpose**: Creates hands-on learning materials with exercises and demos.

**Enhanced Capabilities**:

1. Generates complete directory structures
2. Creates starter files and solution templates
3. Develops step-by-step exercises
4. Builds interactive demos
5. Includes team workflow examples

**Resource Kit Components**:

- **Exercise Frameworks**: Guided practice with starter/solution files
- **Demo Walkthroughs**: Step-by-step demonstrations
- **Team Workflows**: Collaborative usage patterns
- **Enterprise Scenarios**: Large-scale deployment examples
- **Integration Patterns**: Multi-feature combinations

## 🎯 Template System

### Training Template (`feature-training.md`)

The training template ensures consistent, comprehensive coverage:

```yaml
---
feature: "[Feature Name]"
release: "[Release Version]"
prerequisites:
  - "[Prerequisite features]"
audience: "[Target users]"
---
```

**Content Sections**:

- **Overview**: Feature identification and summary
- **Why It Matters**: Value proposition and target audience
- **Feature Details**: Technical implementation and access
- **Step-by-Step Usage**: Practical instructions
- **Examples**: Code samples and configurations
