```markdown
# Custom Instructions for Sample Fullstack App

## Project Overview
This is a full-stack TypeScript application with React frontend and Node.js Express backend. The project emphasizes type safety, modern development practices, and comprehensive testing.

## Architecture and Structure

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for complex state, React hooks for local state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility classes, styled-components for custom components
- **Testing**: React Testing Library with Jest
- **Build Tool**: Create React App with TypeScript template

### Backend (Node.js + Express)
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express framework
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Middleware**: Helmet for security, Morgan for logging, CORS for cross-origin requests
- **Testing**: Jest for unit and integration tests
- **Development**: Nodemon for hot reloading

## Coding Standards and Conventions

### TypeScript Standards
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Prefer `type` over `interface` for union types
- Use generic types for reusable components
- Always specify return types for functions

```typescript
// Preferred function signature style
export const createUser = async (userData: CreateUserRequest): Promise<User> => {
  // Implementation
};

// Preferred interface definition
interface User {
  id: string;
  email: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

### React Component Standards

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement TypeScript interfaces for props
- Follow container/presentational component pattern
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Implement proper error boundaries

```typescript
// Preferred component structure
interface UserProfileProps {
  user: User;
  onUpdate: (user: User) => void;
}

export const UserProfile: React.FC<UserProfileProps> = ({ user, onUpdate }) => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

### State Management

- Use Redux Toolkit for global state
- Implement async thunks for API calls
- Create typed selectors with proper return types
- Use React Query for server state management
- Keep local state in components when appropriate

```typescript
// Preferred Redux slice structure
export const userSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'user',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    setUser: (state, action: PayloadAction<User>) => {
      state.currentUser = action.payload;
    },
  },
  extraReducers: (builder) => {
    builder
      .addCase(fetchUser.pending, (state) => {
        state.loading = true;
      })
      .addCase(fetchUser.fulfilled, (state, action) => {
        state.loading = false;
        state.currentUser = action.payload;
      });
  },
});
```

### Express API Standards

- Use Express Router for route organization
- Implement middleware for authentication and validation
- Follow RESTful API design principles
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Implement comprehensive error handling

```typescript
// Preferred route structure
router.post('/users', 
  validateRequest(createUserSchema),
  authMiddleware,
  async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {
    try {
      const user = await userService.createUser(req.body);
      res.status(201).json({ user });
    } catch (error) {
      next(error);
    }
  }
);
```

## Testing Standards

### Frontend Testing

- Use React Testing Library for component tests
- Test user interactions and component behavior
- Mock external dependencies and API calls
- Achieve minimum 80% code coverage
- Write descriptive test names and organize with describe blocks

```typescript
// Preferred test structure
describe('UserProfile Component', () => {
  it('should display user information correctly', () => {
    const mockUser = { id: '1', email: 'test@example.com' };
    render(<UserProfile user={mockUser} onUpdate={jest.fn()} />);
    
    expect(screen.getByText(mockUser.email)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Backend Testing

- Use Jest for unit and integration tests
- Test API endpoints with supertest
- Mock database operations and external services
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Use test databases for integration tests

```typescript
// Preferred API test structure
describe('POST /api/users', () => {
  it('should create a new user with valid data', async () => {
    const userData = { email: 'test@example.com', password: 'secure123' };
    
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/users')
      .send(userData)
      .expect(201);
      
    expect(response.body.user).toHaveProperty('id');
    expect(response.body.user.email).toBe(userData.email);
  });
});
```

## Error Handling

### Frontend Error Handling

- Implement React Error Boundaries for component errors
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Display user-friendly error messages
- Log errors for debugging and monitoring

### Backend Error Handling

- Use centralized error handling middleware
- Return consistent error response format
- Log errors with appropriate severity levels
- Implement proper HTTP status codes

```typescript
// Preferred error response format
interface ErrorResponse {
  error: {
    message: string;
    code: string;
    details?: any;
  };
}
```

## Security Practices

- Validate all user inputs
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Use HTTPS in production
- Sanitize data before database operations

## Performance Considerations

- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading
- Optimize database queries and add proper indexing
- Use caching strategies for frequently accessed data
- Monitor and profile application performance

## Styling Guidelines

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes for common styles
- Create styled-components for complex custom styles
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain consistent spacing and typography
- Use CSS custom properties for theme values

## API Design Principles

- Follow RESTful conventions for endpoints
- Use proper HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Implement pagination for list endpoints
- Version APIs for backward compatibility
- Document APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger

When generating code, please follow these established patterns and conventions to maintain consistency with the existing codebase.

### Phase 5: Continuous Improvement Process

#### Monthly Review Workflow

```markdown
Monthly Instruction Review Process:

Week 1: Data Collection
- Gather usage metrics from VS Code telemetry
- Collect team feedback via survey
- Analyze code review comments for pattern violations
- Review support tickets related to coding standards

Week 2: Analysis and Planning
- Identify improvement opportunities
- Prioritize updates based on impact
- Plan instruction modifications
- Schedule team discussion sessions

Week 3: Implementation
- Update instruction files
- Test changes with pilot group
- Gather initial feedback
- Refine based on pilot results

Week 4: Rollout and Training
- Deploy updated instructions to full team
- Conduct training session on changes
- Update documentation and examples
- Schedule follow-up review
```

#### Feedback Collection System

```typescript
// Feedback collection integration
interface InstructionFeedback {
  userId: string;
  timestamp: Date;
  suggestion: string;
  category: 'improvement' | 'bug' | 'addition';
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  affectedAreas: string[];
}

// VS Code extension for feedback collection
const collectFeedback = async (feedback: InstructionFeedback) => {
  await submitToTeamBoard(feedback);
  await notifyMaintainers(feedback);
  await updateMetrics(feedback);
};
```

now write components that follow our design system patterns from day one. 
The AI suggestions include proper TypeScript types, accessibility attributes, 
and our preferred testing patterns automatically."

- Sarah, Frontend Lead
```

#### Backend Team Success

```markdown
"API development became much more consistent. Copilot now suggests our 
preferred error handling patterns, includes proper validation middleware, 
and follows our security standards. Code reviews focus on business logic 
instead of style and pattern corrections."

- Mike, Backend Architect
