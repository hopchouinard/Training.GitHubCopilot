```markdown
# Exercise 1: Basic Auto-Approval Configuration

## Goal
Learn to configure terminal command auto-approval in VS Code Agent mode with basic allow/deny lists for common development commands.

## Task
Set up auto-approval for safe development commands while blocking potentially dangerous operations:
1. Create auto-approval configuration file
2. Define allow list for common development commands
3. Set up deny list for dangerous operations
4. Test the configuration with Agent mode
5. Validate safety measures are working

## Safe Commands to Allow
- File operations: `ls`, `cat`, `grep`, `find`
- Git operations: `git status`, `git log`, `git diff`
- Package management: `npm install`, `npm test`, `npm run`
- Development tools: `code`, `echo`, `pwd`

## Dangerous Commands to Block
- System operations: `sudo`, `rm -rf`, `chmod 777`
- Network operations: `curl`, `wget`, `ssh`
- Process control: `kill`, `killall`, `pkill`
- System modification: `mv /`, `dd`, `format`

## Steps
1. Open VS Code settings (Ctrl+,)
2. Search for "copilot terminal auto approval"
3. Enable the experimental auto-approval feature
4. Create configuration file using the starter template
5. Test with Agent mode terminal commands
6. Verify allow/deny behavior

## Success Criteria
- Auto-approval is enabled and configured
- Safe commands execute automatically
- Dangerous commands require manual approval
- Configuration follows security best practices
- Agent respects the approval rules

## Tips
- Start with minimal allow list and expand gradually
- Test each command category before production use
- Use regex patterns for flexible matching
- Monitor auto-approval logs for unexpected behavior

```markdown
# Sample Commands for Testing Auto-Approval

## Safe Commands (Should Auto-Approve)

### File Operations
```bash
ls
ls -la
cat README.md
grep "function" src/*.js
find . -name "*.json"
pwd
echo "Hello World"
```

### Git Operations

```

## Testing Procedure

1. **Enable auto-approval** in VS Code settings
2. **Start Agent mode** and request command execution
3. **Test safe commands** - should execute automatically
4. **Test confirmation commands** - should prompt for approval
5. **Test dangerous commands** - should be blocked
6. **Check audit logs** for proper recording
7. **Verify notifications** work as configured

## Expected Behavior

- ‚úÖ Safe commands execute without prompts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Confirmation commands show approval dialog
- ‚ùå Dangerous commands are blocked with explanation
- üìù All actions are logged for audit purposes
- üîî Notifications appear for denied/confirmation commands

```

# Exercise 2: Advanced Safety Policies

## Goal
Create environment-specific safety policies for development, staging, and production environments with role-based access controls.

## Task
Design comprehensive safety policies that:
1. Adapt to different environments (dev/staging/prod)
2. Implement role-based command permissions
3. Include audit logging and monitoring
4. Provide emergency override procedures
5. Support team collaboration workflows

## Environment Considerations

### Development Environment
- More permissive for productivity
- Allow build and test commands
- Enable file manipulation within project
- Restrict system-level operations

### Staging Environment
- Moderate restrictions for testing
- Allow deployment commands
- Restrict data modification
- Enable monitoring and logging

### Production Environment
- Highly restrictive for safety
- Only allow read-only operations
- Require manual approval for changes
- Comprehensive audit logging

## Role-Based Access

### Developer Role
- File operations within project
- Git operations (non-destructive)
- Package management
- Local development tools

### DevOps Role
- Deployment commands
- Service management
- Configuration changes
- System monitoring

### Admin Role
- All operations with confirmation
- Emergency override capabilities
- Audit log access
- Policy modification

## Steps
1. Analyze environment requirements
2. Define role-based command categories
3. Create environment-specific policies
4. Implement safety mechanisms
5. Test policies across scenarios
6. Document emergency procedures

## Success Criteria
- Policies adapt to environment context
- Role-based permissions work correctly
- Audit logging captures all actions
- Emergency procedures are documented
- Team workflows are supported

## Advanced Features
- Context-aware command analysis
- Dynamic policy updates
- Integration with external systems
- Compliance reporting
- Incident response procedures
```

```markdown
# Demo: Workflow Automation with Auto-Approval

## Overview
Demonstration of how terminal command auto-approval enhances development workflows by automating safe operations while maintaining security.

## Workflow Scenarios

### 1. Git Workflow Automation
Watch how auto-approval streamlines common git operations while protecting against destructive commands.

#### Safe Git Operations (Auto-Approved)
- `git status` - Check repository status
- `git log --oneline -10` - View recent commits
- `git diff` - Show current changes
- `git branch` - List branches
- `git stash list` - View stashed changes

#### Protected Git Operations (Require Confirmation)
- `git push origin main` - Requires confirmation for remote changes
- `git reset --hard HEAD~1` - Destructive operation needs approval
- `git clean -fd` - File deletion requires confirmation

#### Demonstration Flow
```

Agent: "Show me the current git status and recent commits"
‚Üí Executes: git status (auto-approved)
‚Üí Executes: git log --oneline -10 (auto-approved)

Agent: "Push these changes to the main branch"
‚Üí Shows: git push origin main (requires confirmation)
‚Üí User: Clicks "Approve" after reviewing changes

```

### 2. Build and Development Automation
See how auto-approval accelerates development tasks while preventing dangerous operations.

#### Build Commands (Auto-Approved)
- `npm install` - Safe dependency installation
- `npm test` - Run test suite
- `npm run build` - Build project
- `npm run dev` - Start development server

#### Package Management (Protected)
- `npm uninstall package` - Requires confirmation
- `npm publish` - Publishing requires approval
- `npm audit fix --force` - Force fixes need confirmation

#### Demonstration Flow
```

Agent: "Install dependencies and run tests"
‚Üí Executes: npm install (auto-approved)
‚Üí Executes: npm test (auto-approved)
‚Üí Shows: Test results automatically

Agent: "Remove the unused lodash package"
‚Üí Shows: npm uninstall lodash (requires confirmation)
‚Üí User: Reviews impact and approves

```

## Benefits Demonstrated

### Productivity Gains
- **Faster Execution**: Safe commands run immediately
- **Reduced Interruptions**: No prompts for routine operations
- **Streamlined Workflows**: Complex tasks automated safely

### Security Benefits
- **Risk Prevention**: Dangerous commands blocked automatically
- **Selective Approval**: Only risky operations require confirmation
- **Audit Trail**: All actions logged for review

### Team Collaboration
- **Consistent Policies**: Same rules across team members
- **Shared Configuration**: Team-wide safety standards
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Best practices embedded in policies

## Real-World Impact

### Before Auto-Approval
```

Agent: "Check git status"
User: Manually approve "git status"
Agent: "Show recent commits"  
User: Manually approve "git log --oneline -10"
Agent: "Run tests"
User: Manually approve "npm test"

```
**Result**: 3 manual approvals for routine operations

### After Auto-Approval
```

# Demo: Team Configuration and Management

## Overview
Complete walkthrough of implementing terminal auto-approval across a development team with role-based access and centralized management.

## Team Structure

### Roles and Responsibilities
- **Developers**: Daily coding, testing, and git operations
- **DevOps Engineers**: Deployment, infrastructure, and monitoring
- **Team Leads**: Code review, project management, and oversight
- **Security Team**: Policy management and compliance oversight

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Policy Development (Week 1)

#### Step 1: Risk Assessment
```markdown
Risk Categories:
- High Risk: System modification, network operations, process control
- Medium Risk: File operations outside project, git push operations
- Low Risk: Read operations, status checks, local development
```

#### Step 2: Role Definition

```json
{
  "roles": {
    "developer": {
      "description": "Standard development operations",
      "riskLevel": "low-medium",
      "autoApprovalLimit": 50
    },
    "devops": {
      "description": "Infrastructure and deployment operations", 
      "riskLevel": "medium-high",
      "autoApprovalLimit": 30
    },
    "lead": {
      "description": "Management and oversight operations",
      "riskLevel": "medium",
      "autoApprovalLimit": 40
    }
  }
}
```

#### Step 3: Environment Policies

```
Development: Permissive for productivity
Staging: Moderate restrictions for testing
Production: Highly restrictive for safety
```

### Phase 2: Pilot Implementation (Week 2)

#### Pilot Group Selection

- 3 developers from different teams
- 1 DevOps engineer
- 1 team lead

#### Configuration Deployment

```bash
# Shared configuration via Settings Sync
1. Create team policy repository
2. Configure VS Code Settings Sync
3. Deploy to pilot group
4. Monitor usage patterns
```

#### Feedback Collection

```markdown
Daily Metrics:
- Commands auto-approved vs. denied
- User satisfaction scores
- Productivity impact measurements
- Security incident reports
```

### Phase 3: Full Rollout (Week 3-4)

#### Gradual Deployment

```
Week 3: Core development teams (20 users)
Week 4: Extended teams and stakeholders (50 users)
```

#### Training and Documentation

- Configuration overview sessions
- Emergency procedure training
- Best practices documentation
- Troubleshooting guides
