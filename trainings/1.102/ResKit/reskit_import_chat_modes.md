## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup

#### Central Repository Establishment
```yaml
# Repository Configuration
name: "Enterprise Copilot Configuration"
description: "Centralized AI customization repository"
access_control: "organization-members"
branch_protection:
  main:
    required_reviews: 2
    dismiss_stale_reviews: true
    require_code_owner_reviews: true
    required_status_checks:
      - security-scan
      - compliance-check
      - quality-validation
```

#### Security Infrastructure

```json
{
  "security_policies": {
    "content_scanning": {
      "enabled": true,
      "scan_types": ["malware", "secrets", "compliance"],
      "block_on_issues": true
    },
    "access_control": {
      "type": "rbac",
      "roles": ["viewer", "contributor", "approver", "admin"],
      "mfa_required": true
    },
    "audit_logging": {
      "enabled": true,
      "retention_period": "7years",
      "real_time_monitoring": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Approval Workflow

#### Mode Approval Process

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Mode Submission] --> B[Security Scan]
    B --> C[Compliance Review]
    C --> D[Technical Review]
    D --> E[Governance Approval]
    E --> F[Testing Phase]
    F --> G[Production Deployment]
    
    B -->|Issues Found| H[Reject & Report]
    C -->|Non-Compliant| H
    D -->|Technical Issues| H
    E -->|Governance Denied| H
    F -->|Testing Failed| H
```

#### Approval Workflow Implementation

```python
class ModeApprovalWorkflow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.security_scanner = SecurityScanner()
        self.compliance_checker = ComplianceChecker()
        self.technical_reviewer = TechnicalReviewer()
        self.governance_board = GovernanceBoard()
    
    async def process_submission(self, mode_submission):
        # Step 1: Security Scan
        security_result = await self.security_scanner.scan(mode_submission)
        if not security_result.passed:
            return self.reject(security_result.issues)
        
        # Step 2: Compliance Review
        compliance_result = await self.compliance_checker.review(mode_submission)
        if not compliance_result.compliant:
            return self.reject(compliance_result.violations)
        
        # Step 3: Technical Review
        technical_result = await self.technical_reviewer.evaluate(mode_submission)
        if not technical_result.approved:
            return self.reject(technical_result.feedback)
        
        # Step 4: Governance Approval
        governance_result = await self.governance_board.review(mode_submission)
        if not governance_result.approved:
            return self.reject(governance_result.reasons)
        
        # Step 5: Automated Testing
        test_result = await self.run_automated_tests(mode_submission)
        if not test_result.passed:
            return self.reject(test_result.failures)
        
        # Step 6: Production Deployment
        return await self.deploy_to_production(mode_submission)
```

### Phase 3: Distribution and Management

#### Automated Distribution System

```typescript
interface DistributionConfig {
  target_groups: string[];
  deployment_strategy: 'immediate' | 'phased' | 'manual';
  rollback_policy: {
    automatic: boolean;
    trigger_conditions: string[];
    rollback_timeout: number;
  };
  monitoring: {
    success_metrics: string[];
    failure_thresholds: Record<string, number>;
    alert_channels: string[];
  };
}

class EnterpriseDistributor {
  async distributeMode(mode: ApprovedMode, config: DistributionConfig) {
    // Create distribution packages
    const packages = await this.createDistributionPackages(mode, config);
    
    // Deploy to target groups
    for (const group of config.target_groups) {
      await this.deployToGroup(packages[group], group, config);
    }
    
    // Monitor deployment success
    await this.monitorDeployment(mode.id, config.monitoring);
  }
}
```

## Security and Compliance

  mode_name,
  COUNT(*) as usage_count,
  AVG(satisfaction_score) as avg_satisfaction,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as unique_users
FROM mode_usage_logs 
WHERE timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
GROUP BY mode_name
ORDER BY usage_count DESC;

-- Security incident tracking
SELECT
