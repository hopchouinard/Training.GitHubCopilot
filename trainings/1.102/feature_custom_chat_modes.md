   tools: ["codebase", "search", "problems"]
   model: "gpt-4"
   ---
   ```

3. **Add Custom Instructions:**

   ```markdown
   # Security-Focused Code Review Mode
   
   You are a security-focused code reviewer. When reviewing code:
   - Check for common security vulnerabilities
   - Verify input validation and sanitization
   - Look for authentication and authorization issues
   - Suggest secure coding practices
   ```

4. **Save and Use:**
   - Save the `.chatmode.md` file
   - Mode appears in Chat view mode selector
   - Select mode before starting conversations

### 3.4 Example(s)

- **Simple example:**  
  Create a "Planning Mode" for project planning discussions:

  ```markdown
  ---
  description: "Project planning and architecture discussions"
  tools: ["codebase", "search"]
  ---
  
  # Planning Assistant
  
  Focus on high-level architecture and planning. Break down complex 
  features into smaller tasks and suggest implementation strategies.
  ```

- **Advanced/tip:**  
  Create a team-specific mode that references external instruction files:

  ```markdown
  ---
  description: "Company coding standards reviewer"
  tools: ["codebase", "search", "problems", "editFiles"]
  model: "gpt-4-turbo"
  ---
  
  # Company Standards Mode
  
  @file:company-coding-standards.md
  
  Apply our company's coding standards when reviewing and suggesting code.
  ```

**Mode comparison:**

| Built-in Modes | Custom Modes |

## 4. Troubleshooting & FAQ

- **Q: Where should I save my custom chat modes?**
  - A: For team sharing, save in workspace `.vscode/` folder. For personal use, save in user profile directory.

- **Q: Can I share modes with my team?**
  - A: Yes, modes saved in the workspace are automatically available to all team members who open the project.

- **Q: What tools can I specify in custom modes?**
  - A: Built-in tools like "codebase", "search", "editFiles", "problems", plus any tools provided by extensions or MCP servers.

- **Q: How do I import modes from the community?**
  - A: Use `vscode:` links from repositories like awesome-copilot, or copy `.chatmode.md` files directly.

- **Q: Can I use different AI models in different modes?**
  - A: Yes, specify the `model` property in the metadata. IntelliSense provides available model options.

**Common Issues:**

- **Mode not appearing:** Check file extension is `.chatmode.md` and file is in correct location
- **Tools not working:** Verify tool names are correct and required extensions are installed
- **Model not available:** Ensure specified model is available in your Copilot subscription
