## 4. Troubleshooting & FAQ

### Common Issues

- **Agent Button Not Appearing:** Ensure `githubPullRequests.codingAgent.uiIntegration` is enabled and repository is eligible
- **No Session Logs:** Check GitHub Copilot subscription status and permissions
- **Graph View Missing Files:** Ensure Git repository is properly initialized and has commit history
- **Context Addition Fails:** Verify chat extension is active and commit is accessible

### How to Disable

- **Disable Agent Integration:** Set `githubPullRequests.codingAgent.uiIntegration` to `false`
- **Stop Active Sessions:** Use "Copilot on My Behalf" â†’ Select session â†’ Stop
- **Remove History Context:** Delete context items from chat input
- **Traditional Workflow:** Continue using standard Git commands and PR creation

### Edge Cases

- **Large Repository Performance:** Graph view may be slow with very large commit histories
- **Complex Merge Conflicts:** Agent may require human intervention for complex conflicts
- **Permission Issues:** Agent requires appropriate repository write permissions
- **Network Connectivity:** Session monitoring requires stable internet connection

### FAQ
