2. Define tool sets for GitHub notifications, file operations, and development tasks
3. Use tool sets in chat queries with #-mention syntax
4. Configure tool availability in different chat modes
5. Test tool set functionality in agent mode

## Input/Output
**Starter**: Template tool sets configuration
**Expected Outcome**: Working tool sets accessible via #-mention in chat with organized tool groupings

## Steps

1. **Create Tool Sets File**
   - Run Command Palette â†’ `Configure Tool Sets` â†’ `Create new tool sets file`
   - Use the provided template as starting point
   - Define at least 3 different tool sets

2. **Configure GitHub Notifications Tool Set**
    ```json
    {
        "gh-news": {
        "tools": [
            "list_notifications",
            "dismiss_notification",
            "get_notification_details"
        ],
        "description": "Manage GitHub notifications",
        "icon": "github-project"
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Test Tool Set Usage**
   - Open VS Code Chat
   - Use #-mention syntax: `#gh-news help me manage my notifications`
   - Verify tools are available and working
   - Test tool picker integration

4. **Create Additional Tool Sets**
   - File operations tool set
   - Development workflow tool set
   - Code review tool set

## Steps

1. **Visual Message Distinction**
   - Start multiple chat conversations
   - Observe user vs AI message styling
   - Practice identifying message types quickly
   - Test with various message lengths

2. **Undo Functionality**
   - Make several chat requests with file edits
   - Practice hover-to-undo on individual requests
   - Use `Ctrl+Shift+Z` keyboard shortcut
   - Test undoing partial conversation chains

3. **Attachment Navigation**
   - Add multiple file attachments to chat
   - Practice navigating between attachments
   - Test drag-and-drop functionality
   - Use keyboard navigation within attachments

4. **Edit Operation Modes**
   - Test both editing approaches:
     - Top-to-bottom file rewrite
     - Multiple smaller edits
   - Observe auto-save behavior changes
   - Practice new Keep/Undo keybindings

5. **Keyboard Shortcuts Mastery**

   ```
   Ctrl+Shift+Z - Undo chat edits
   Ctrl+K - Accept all changes in file
   Ctrl+Shift+K - Reject all changes in file
   Ctrl+Enter - Accept individual change
   Ctrl+Shift+Enter - Reject individual change
   ```

## Tips

## Message Distinction Practice

Try these prompts to see the visual distinction between user and AI messages:

1. "Explain how async/await works in JavaScript"
2. "Show me an example of a React component"
3. "What are the benefits of TypeScript?"
4. "Help me debug this function: [paste code]"

## Undo Functionality Practice

Use these prompts that create editable changes:

1. "Add error handling to this function"
2. "Refactor this code to use modern ES6 syntax"
3. "Add JSDoc comments to these functions"
4. "Convert this callback to use promises"

Practice undoing these changes using:
- Hover and click X button
- Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+Z)

## Attachment Navigation Practice

Create scenarios with multiple attachments:

1. Add 3-4 different code files
2. Add configuration files (package.json, tsconfig.json)
3. Add documentation files (README.md, docs)
4. Practice navigating between them efficiently

## Keyboard Shortcuts Practice

Test these scenarios:

1. Make edits and accept all changes (Ctrl+K)
2. Make edits and reject all changes (Ctrl+Shift+K)
3. Accept individual changes (Ctrl+Enter)
4. Reject individual changes (Ctrl+Shift+Enter)
```

# Chat UX Keyboard Shortcuts Reference

## Primary Shortcuts

| Action | Shortcut | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Undo Chat Edits | `Ctrl+Shift+Z` | Undo the last chat request and all following requests |
| Accept All Changes | `Ctrl+K` | Accept all changes in the current file |
| Reject All Changes | `Ctrl+Shift+K` | Reject all changes in the current file |
| Accept Individual Change | `Ctrl+Enter` | Accept the current hunk/change |
| Reject Individual Change | `Ctrl+Shift+Enter` | Reject the current hunk/change |

## Context-Specific Shortcuts

### Chat Input
| Action | Shortcut | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Add Current File Context | `Shift+Tab, Enter` | Quickly add current file as context |
| Navigate Attachments | `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Move between attached files |
| Submit Query | `Ctrl+Enter` | Send the chat message |

### During Edits
| Action | Shortcut | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Navigate Changes | `F8` / `Shift+F8` | Jump between edit hunks |
| Toggle Diff View | `Ctrl+Shift+D` | Switch between diff and full view |
| Focus Editor | `Escape` | Return focus to main editor |

## Workflow Tips

### Efficient Editing Workflow
1. Make chat request for changes
2. Review changes in diff view (`Ctrl+Shift+D`)
3. Navigate between hunks (`F8`)
4. Accept/reject individual changes (`Ctrl+Enter`/`Ctrl+Shift+Enter`)
5. Or accept/reject all (`Ctrl+K`/`Ctrl+Shift+K`)

### Safe Experimentation
1. Make experimental chat request
2. Review results
3. If unsatisfied, use `Ctrl+Shift+Z` to undo
4. Try alternative approach

### Context Management
1. Use `Shift+Tab, Enter` to quickly add current file
2. Navigate attachments with `Tab`
3. Remove unwanted attachments before submitting

## Accessibility Features

- All actions have keyboard equivalents
- Screen reader support for message distinction
- High contrast mode compatible
- Consistent focus management throughout chat interface
```

# UX Improvements Workflow Examples

## Example 1: Code Refactoring with Undo

### Scenario
Refactoring a JavaScript function to use modern syntax.

### Workflow
1. **Initial Request**: "Refactor this function to use arrow syntax and destructuring"
2. **Review Changes**: Examine the proposed edits in diff view
3. **Partial Accept**: Accept the arrow function change (`Ctrl+Enter`)
4. **Reject Destructuring**: Reject destructuring change (`Ctrl+Shift+Enter`)
5. **Undo if Needed**: If not satisfied, use `Ctrl+Shift+Z` to start over

### Benefits
- Granular control over changes
- Safe experimentation
- Quick recovery from unwanted edits

## Example 2: Multi-File Documentation Update

### Scenario
Updating documentation across multiple files.

### Workflow
1. **Add Context**: Attach README.md, API.md, and CHANGELOG.md
2. **Navigate Attachments**: Use `Tab` to review each file
3. **Submit Request**: "Update all documentation for the new v2.0 API"
4. **Review in Sequence**: Use `F8` to navigate between files and changes
5. **Selective Acceptance**: Accept documentation updates, reject version changes

### Benefits
- Efficient multi-file handling
- Visual distinction helps track progress
- Attachment navigation improves workflow

## Example 3: Iterative Development with Visual Distinction

### Scenario
Building a feature through multiple chat iterations.

### Workflow
1. **Initial Planning**: User message clearly distinguished from AI response
2. **Implementation Request**: Visual separation makes conversation easy to follow
3. **Testing Request**: Clear message history helps track progress
4. **Bug Fix Request**: Easy to identify conversation flow
5. **Final Review**: Message distinction aids in reviewing entire conversation

### Benefits
- Clear conversation flow
- Easy to track development progress
- Reduced cognitive load when reviewing history

## Example 4: Floating Window Multi-Project Workflow

### Scenario
Working on two projects simultaneously.

### Workflow
1. **Main Project**: Keep primary chat in main VS Code window
2. **Secondary Project**: Drag chat to floating window for second project
3. **Context Switching**: Use dock/undock buttons to move chat as needed
4. **New Conversations**: Start new chat in floating window when needed
5. **Parallel Development**: Work on both projects with separate chat contexts

### Benefits
- Multi-project support
- Flexible window management
- Separate conversation contexts
- Improved productivity for complex workflows

## Best Practices

### For Keyboard Users
- Learn all shortcuts for maximum efficiency
- Use keyboard navigation for attachments
- Rely on shortcuts for edit operations

### For Mouse Users
- Utilize hover states for additional actions
- Drag and drop for attachment management
- Click-based undo operations

### For All Users
- Experiment safely with undo functionality
- Use visual cues to track conversation flow
- Take advantage of attachment navigation
- Leverage floating windows for complex workflows
